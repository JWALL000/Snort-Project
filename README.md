## Project Overview 
Welcome to my project! In this project, I successfully configured a working instance of Snort and added a ruleset using PulledPork. In case you're not familiar, Snort is an open-source IDS/IPS system (depending on how it is deployed). In this case, I used it as an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to parse a known malicious PCAP file and detect suspicious activity.

This project further expanded my knowledge of IDS tools and helped me understand their value in real-world security environments.

Thank you for checking out my project, please see below for the details of how I set it up!
