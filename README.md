## Project Overview 
Welcome to my project! In this project, I successfully configured a working instance of Snort and added a ruleset using PulledPork. In case you're not familiar, Snort is an open-source IDS/IPS system (depending on how it is deployed). In this case, I used it as an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to parse a known malicious PCAP file and detect suspicious activity.

This project further expanded my knowledge of IDS tools and helped me understand their value in real-world security environments.

Thank you for checking out my project, please see below for the details of how I set it up!

## Step 1. 

In this step I started by SSh'ing into my ubuntu server, I do this because I find it easier to work from PowerShell in my host as I find it generally more user friendly.

## Step 2. 

Next, It was time to update my ubuntu server and confirm the upgrade.

## Step 3. 

Then, I had to install some prerequisites in order for snort to work correctly as you can see there was quite a bit to install before we get to installing snort.

This also included locating and installing the newest C ++ libraries.
