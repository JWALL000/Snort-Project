## Project Overview 
Welcome to my project. In this project I successfully configured a working instance of snort and added a ruleset form pulled pork. In case you didn,t know, Snort is an open source IDS/IPS sustem (depending on how it is deployed), but here I used it 
as an IDS system to parse through a known malicious pcap to detect malicous activity. This project further expanded my knowledge of IDS systems and made me realise how useful they could be in a real world environment. 
Thanks for viewing my project and please see how I did this below!
